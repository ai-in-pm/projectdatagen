# ProjectDataGen

ProjectDataGen is an advanced AI-powered platform for generating comprehensive project management datasets tailored for government contracts, including IPMDAR, PARS, and DECM reporting requirements. The platform specializes in industries like aerospace, defense, and Space Force operations, and supports a wide range of project management methodologies such as Agile, Earned Schedule, and Behavioral Project Management. Designed to handle multiple contract types (CPFF, CPIF, CPAF, etc.) and scales from small projects to enterprise-level initiatives, ProjectDataGen delivers intelligent data generation for earned value management, behavioral analytics, and compliance reporting.

## Features

### Data Structurer AI
Creates intelligent schemas for Earned Value Management Systems (EVMS) compliance, IPMDAR/PARS reporting, and Space Force operational data. The Data Structurer AI can handle complex data structures across various contract types, from CPFF to IDIQ, and is equipped to support behavioral metrics, earned schedule, and integrated project management frameworks.

### Data Generator AI
Generates realistic datasets with sophisticated correlations across EVM metrics, schedule performance, and behavioral patterns. The Data Generator AI adapts to project complexity levels and is compatible with multiple methodologies, from traditional PMI standards to Agile and cognitive project management approaches.

### Data Validator AI
Ensures data compliance with Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) standards, EVMS guidelines, and IPMDAR reporting requirements. It performs comprehensive validation of earned value metrics, schedule performance, and data integrity, aligning with specific methodology requirements and contract type constraints.

### Data Exporter AI
Formats data for government systems, contract deliverables, and program reviews. The Data Exporter AI supports multiple export formats, including CSV, Excel, XML, and JSON, and provides specific formatting for IPMDAR, PARS, and DECM submissions. It also creates audit-ready datasets with full compliance documentation.
